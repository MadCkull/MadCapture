# MadCapture: UI & Flow Perfection 💎

I've refined the app to ensure every interaction feels premium and every piece of information is accurate.

## 🛠️ Logic & Reliability Fixes
- **Robust Page Scan**: Fixed the "Scan Page" feature to work even if the extension hasn't been initialized on that page yet.
- **Accurate Metadata**: Restored full image dimensions (WxH) and file sizes (KB) in the cards by pre-loading images during processing.
- **Intentional Loading Flow**: Images now go through a full "Processing" phase with a progress bar *before* appearing in the grid, ensuring everything is ready to view.
- **No More "Searching..." Hangs**: Fixed the indicator timing so it resets accurately.

## ✨ Premium UI Polish
- **Modern Format Selection**: Replaced the old dropdown with sleek, interactive **Format Badges**.
- **Stats Info Panel**: Added a new footer section that shows exactly how many images were found and how many you have selected.
- **Cleaner Toolbar**: Removed the redundant download button from the bottom; you now have one primary download action in the top-right and footer stats.

## 🚀 Ready to Use
1. Reload MadCapture in `chrome://extensions`.
2. Try the **Scan Page** icon.
3. Watch the new loading flow and check the stats footer!
